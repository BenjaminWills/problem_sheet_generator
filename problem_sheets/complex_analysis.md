Sure, here are five practice questions on complex analysis:

1. Define the complex conjugate of a complex number and prove that the product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number.
2. Find the principal value of $\sqrt{-1 + i}$ and plot the roots in the complex plane.
3. Calculate the residue of $f(z) = \frac{1}{z^3 + 1}$ at $z = -e^{\frac{i\pi}{3}}$ using the residue theorem.
4. State and prove Cauchy's integral theorem for a closed contour in a simply connected region.
5. Show that if $f(z)$ is an entire function and $|\mathrm{Im}(f(z))| \leq 5$ for all $z$, then $f(z)$ is constant.

Note: For question 5, you might want to provide some real-world context for the problem, as it might not be immediately apparent why the question is interesting or relevant. One possible context might be the analysis of financial data, where $f(z)$ might represent a time series of stock prices or exchange rates, and the condition on the imaginary part of $f(z)$ might be imposed to capture some property of the data or the underlying economic factors.
