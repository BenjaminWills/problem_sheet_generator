Sure! Here's a problem sheet with 3 questions about linear algebra:

1) Let S = {(-3, 1, 4), (2, -2, 5), (7, -5, 19)}. Determine if S is a linearly independent set.

2) Let v1 = (1, 2, -1), v2 = (2, 4, 5), and v3 = (-1, -2, 7). Determine if the vector (1, 2, 3) is in the span of v1, v2 and v3.

3) Let S = {(1, 3, 1), (2, 1, 2), (3, 4, 3)}. Determine if S is a spanning set for R^3.

For each problem, provide a clear and concise explanation of the steps taken to arrive at the solution, and use Latex to denote any mathematical notation or equations. Have fun!
