# MATHEMATICS PROBLEM SHEET GENERATOR

In this project I use the open AI API to generate mathematical problem sheets. The idea could be generalised to any kind of problem sheet or essay question for example. I thought this could be useful for student revision.

## Local Setup

To setup this project locally run:

```sh
make local_build
```

Then to access the docs that have instructions on how to use this application run:

```sh
open http://localhost:3001/
```
