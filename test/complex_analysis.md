Sure, here's a problem sheet with 5 questions about complex analysis:

1. Find the solutions to the equation $z^3 - 4z = 0$ in the complex plane.

2. Let $f(z) = e^z + z^2$. Find the Laurent series of $f(z)$ centered at $z_0 = 0$, and specify the region of convergence.

3. Let $f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^2(z-1)}$. Find the residues of $f(z)$ at $z = 0$ and $z = 1$.

4. Let $f(z)$ be an entire function such that $|f(z)| \leq Ce^{a|z|}$ for some constants $C$ and $a$. Show that $f(z)$ is a polynomial.

5. Define $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{n!}$. Find the radius of convergence of $f(z)$.

Hope this helps!
